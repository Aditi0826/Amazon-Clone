# Amazon Clone Project

## Project Overview

This project is a basic front-end clone of the Amazon website, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The focus was on replicating the design and layout of the Amazon homepage rather than creating a fully functional e-commerce site.

## Features

- **Static Design:** The project replicates the look and feel of the Amazon homepage, including the navigation bar, product listings, and footer.
- **Responsive Layout:** The layout adjusts to different screen sizes, providing a basic responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Basic Hover Effects:** Simple hover effects are applied to buttons and product images to enhance the user experience.
- **Placeholder Elements:** Products, images, and other elements are included as placeholders without functional back-end integration.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Used for structuring the web pages and content.
- **CSS:** Used for styling the website, including layout, colors, and basic responsive design.
- **JavaScript:** Used minimally for simple interactions, such as hover effects.

## What I Learned

- **HTML & CSS Fundamentals:** This project reinforced my understanding of how to structure and style web pages using HTML and CSS.
- **Responsive Design:** I practiced creating responsive layouts using media queries, ensuring that the site adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Project Structuring:** I learned how to organize a project with multiple files, including separating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for better maintainability.
- **Attention to Visual Details:** Replicating a well-known site like Amazon helped me focus on small visual details and consistency in design.

## Conclusion

While this project is basic and not fully functional, it provided a valuable opportunity to practice front-end development skills and gain experience in replicating a real-world website layout. The lessons learned from this project will serve as a foundation for more advanced and interactive web development projects in the future.
